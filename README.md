# Implementation of "Artificial Neural Networks for Solving Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations"

This repository contains the implementation of the paper **“Artificial Neural Networks for Solving Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations”** by Isaac Elias Lagaris, Aristidis Likas, and Dimitrios I. Fotiadis.

### File Structure
- **`yDE_z.txt`**: Contains the description of the problem.  
- **`yDE_z.pynb`**: Jupyter Notebook with the implementation of the corresponding problem.

### Naming Convention
- **`y`**:
  - `O` for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).
  - `P` for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).
- **`z`**:  
  - `1` to `7`, `3i`, or `3b`, representing the specific problem as defined in the paper.

For example:  
- `ODE_3b.txt` and `ODE_3b.pynb` refer to the description and implementation of the "3b" ODE problem.
- `PDE_6.txt` and `PDE_6.pynb` refer to the description and implementation of the sixth PDE problem.
